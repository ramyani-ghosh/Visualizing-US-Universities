        <h1>How Do I Choose a College for Undergrad?</h1>
        <p>Amidst the soaring costs of tuition, US universities remain hubs of ambition and aspiration. Through data-driven visualizations, let's try to unravel the factors influencing various indicators of success for students, both at an individual and an institutional level. These aim to inform a student's decision on how to choose a college.</p>

                <h2>Undergraduate Student Population</h2>
                 <p>The dataset used contains data collected from 2055 US institutions. The average 
                    undergraduate student population is about 4030. The visualization on the left shows a bubble chart 
                    of all these institutions- the larger the bubble, the larger its undergraduate student body. The colors
                    of the bubbles indicate the control of the institution, as outlined below.

                 <p>Being such a large country, the number of colleges for higher education vary 
                    greatly based on the region you're looking in. Travelling outside of one's state is not uncommon for a better education, however, 
                    out-of-state tuition fees are typically significantly higher than in-state.

                <h2>Student Debts</h2>
                 <p style="margin-right: 100px;">Every year, students incur huge sums of money in debt in order to pursue college education.
                    Out of the 2055 institutions in our dataset, 
                    <span id="debt_num" style="color:#A0153E;font-weight: bold;"> 2055 </span> have a median debt of <span id="debt_val" style="color:#A0153E;font-weight: bold;"> $38000 </span> or less. 
                    Move the slider around to play with these values.

                <h2>Admission Rate and Post-Graduation Success</h2>
                 <p>Often, the lower the acceptance rate or admission rate of a university, the better the 
                    quality of education it can provide. This chart plots the admission rates of the university
                    against the mean earnings 8 years after entry into the college. The ones with the highest
                    earnings seem to have very low acceptance rates.
                    Furthermore, the color of the dots shows the percentage of students who completed their degree
                    within 150% of the intended period.

            to enrol in for undergraduate studies. These visualizations aim at highlighting a few of them.
